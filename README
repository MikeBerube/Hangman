This program is a game of hangman. You have a limited number of guesses to find all the letters in the secret word.

Instructions:
Follow the prompts on screen with the goal of finding the secret word.

If I had more time I would add a random dictionary list to get a new word every time and also maybe an ascii art of an actual hangman to have visuals.
